        As a child, I carried a notebook around with me everywhere I went,
        writing a book one sentence at a time. I was obsessed with stories, in
        any format I could consume, be it a novel (I carried a book with me
        wherever I went, too), a movie, a radio show, or a simple joke.
        Everything had a beginning, middle, and end in its retelling, and the
        trick was to figure out how to balance each in a way to keep the other
        person interested.
      </div>
      <div>A tried and true way to do that is with a plot twist.</div>
      <div>
        A plot twist like how after graduating from USC film school wtih my BA
        in Cinema and Television Studies, I ended up teaching high school math
        at an all-boys private school in West Hollywood, despite having not
        taken a single math class my entire time in college.
      </div>
      <div>
        Or maybe it was when, from that, I found myself in a Physics PhD program
        in Austin, Texas, where I secretly spent my free time writing a weekly
        column for the school paper, where I'd take a scientific topic, dive
        into the current research available on the subject, then summarize it in
        600 words or so. With articles ranging from the Kennedy assassination to
        the mating practices of praying mantises to quantum entanglement, the
        challenge of adhering to that word count varied greatly from week to
        week.
      </div>
      <div>
        No, that wasn't the twist. The twist was when I found that the school
        stipend wasn't enough to make ends meet, so I found myself work
        ghostwriting romance novels on the side.
      </div>
      <div>
        I left school for a job in tech, but after a recent "reorganization"
        (i.e. layoffs), I found myself jaded with the industry and eager to
        return to my creative roots.
