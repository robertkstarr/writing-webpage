        An experienced ghostwriter who wears many hats, I have been — at one
        time or another — a math teacher, experimental and theoretical
        physicist, lab instructor, software developer, and newspaper journalist.

        After earning a Bachelors in film from the University of Southern
        California, I was eager to become a Hollywood screenwriter, but life
        sent me down a more technical path studying physics. This path
        ultimately led me to UT Austin, where I entered a PhD program,
        performing research related to molecular modeling in hydrodynamic
        simulations.

        But the creative bug continued to bite at me and I used my storytelling
        skills to write romance novels that helped supplement my monthly
        stipend. Editors quickly became fond of my quick turnaround time,
        creative outlines, and clean copy, while readers found themselves
        turning page after page as a result of my sharp, efficient prose as well
        as the complex characters I created with whom they couldn't help but
        fall in love.

        I'm fortunate to have varied interests and experiences which color my
        writing. My scientific knowledge and ability to do research add a hint
        of realism into even the most fantastical fiction I've written, while my
        knowledge of narrative structure has helped give my non-fiction a kind
        of rhythm to keep the readers' interest. In either case, I have a unique
        voice that stands out in the crowded field of writers working today.
